  After about 7+ years careeer in Geographic Informations Systems(GIS).
  I decided to start a new journey studying iOS development in <a href="https://www.lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a>
  In 1 year I gained solid experience in iOS Engineering with Swift and Objective-C.
  I also had the opportunity to be a Class Lead for new cohorts because of my exceptional effort.
